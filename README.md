Created by Maxwell Hollins.

As the Software Engineer Intern, I was tasked with the goal of creating a new, refined “Know Your Customer” website. The main functionalities of the site needed to include the following:

A working Login, Logout, and Register Form. (Needed to be translatable between English and Spanish via buttons.)
Multiple Form pages (6 in total) that also allowed for image uploading, as well as conditional questions that only showed if other options were selected. (Needed to be translatable between English and Spanish via buttons.)
A database that stores the User’s Form information.
A way to Automate the creation of “Completion Forms” which includes all of the given User’s Form information.
Relatively smooth access for Users to edit information if need be, or reopen their personal data-sheet (that connects to the main database) for further modification.

This is the way in which I approached this project, and just some of the techniques I chose to use with the given objectives.
